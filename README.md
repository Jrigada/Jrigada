# Juan Rigada :computer:

I am a fifth-year student pursuing a degree in <a href="http://www.sistemas.frba.utn.edu.ar/">Information Systems Engineering</a> at the Technological National University of Buenos Aires. I have a passion for shaping situations to solve problems and embarking on projects that involve the application of various technologies. I thoroughly enjoy working with languages like Elixir, Rust, and Erlang.
